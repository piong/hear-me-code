# Fibonnaci Sequence

# Difficulty: Beginner

# NOTE: This is *not* a practical example of how you'll use coding in your day to day, BUT it does appear on a surprising number of in-person coding interviews.  Why employers rely on something so impractical to gauge your coding ability is beyond me.
#       But since they're using it, maybe in this narrow sense it's a practical exercise to know how to do after all.


# Create a program that loops through the numbers 0-100.
# When you land on a number evenly divisible by 3, have your program print "Fizz"
# When you land on a number evenly divisible by 5, have your program print "Buzz"
# When you land on a number evenly divisible by both 3 and 5, have your program print "Fizzbuzz"
# When you land on any other number, print that number

# Remember the % operator will tell you whether a number is evenly divisible by another number! 
# We use it most often to determine whether a number is even or odd, but it's also useful here.

for n in range(1,100):
    if  n % 15 == 0:
        print "Fizzbuzz"
    elif n % 3 == 0:
        print "Fizz"
    elif n % 5 == 0:
        print "Buzz"
    else:
        print n

# When completed, your program output should look like:
